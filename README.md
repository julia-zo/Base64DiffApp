## Available Endpoints

| Operation | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| POST | \<host>/v1/diff/<id>/left | Adds or Updates data to Left side of the diff on given ID |

### Requirements
* Payload must be on JSON format
* Data must be encoded in Base64 

## Deployment
### Prerequisites
* Java JDK 1.8
* Maven 3.3.9

### Running Unit Tests
There are 32 unit tests that set the Line and Branch coverage at 100%.

To run only unit tests:
```
$ mvn clean test -Dtest=\!Base64DiffAppIntTest
```

Unit Test coverage is provided by JaCoCo, you can find the report at `./target/jacoco-coverage/index.html`.

### Running Integration Tests
There are 21 integration tests that set the Line and Branch coverage at 95%.

All integration tests are located in class [Base64DiffAppIntTest](./src/test/java/org/juliazo/diff/Base64DiffAppIntTest.java)

To run only integration tests:
```
$ mvn clean test -Dtest=Base64DiffAppIntTest
```

Integration Test coverage is provided by JaCoCo, you can find the report at `./target/jacoco-coverage/index.html`.

### Running Application
This is a Maven Spring Boot application, to run it, follow these steps:
#### 1) Build the code
```
$ mvn clean package
```
* All unit and integration tests will be executed;
* Application will not compile if there is any test failure;
* Coverage for all tests is available at `./target/jacoco-coverage/index.html`;
#### 2) Run application
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
#### 3) Have fun!
You can access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Examining Logs
Log4J was used to provide logs for this application. All logs are being shown in the console and printed out to a file.

Log level can be changed at [Application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties). Default level is INFO 
for classes inside [juliazo](./src/test/java/org/juliazo) package and ERROR for spring framework related classes.

Log files can be found in `./logs/application.log`.

## Assumptions
* Data persistence was not required, in-memory storage is being used;
* Differences on the data are being portrayed as which bytes differ from one side of the diff to the other;
* It was not defined how to handle a second POST to the same id on the same side of the diff, so I chose to use a 
different response code for this scenario.

## Improvements
* Data persistence could be added to improve reliability;
* The ID could be returned on the error messages for easy tracking;
* Logs could be separated into different files, to facilitate the analysis of the data;
* Logs and error messages could be better formatted to improve autonomous indexing and analysis;
* Create a mechanism to inform the user in a more explicit way which version of each side of the diff is being used
for a given GET diff operation.
